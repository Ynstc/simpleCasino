This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.


/-- Requirements --/
## Developer test

Use React to build a games list casino lobby make sure the code is structured
well and scalable like for a real project. Feel free to add the anything you
feel would add to the games list such as filtering.

### Functionality
1. Load games list from Provider Json
1. Search for a game
1. View Game Image and Name

### Nice to haves
- Server side rendering

### Other Requirements
* Even though this is a small project, structure and architecture should mimic a large project.
* The code should obviously follow best practises (DRY, maintainable, testable, etc.).
* Feel free to add any other features you think might be useful for example: Filters.

### Tools We Use At Scatters.com:
